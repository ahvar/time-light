<!-- The action attribute tells the browser the URL when submitting the information entered in the form. When the action
 is set to an empty string the form is submitted to the URL that is currently in the address bar -->

<!-- The method attribute specifies HTTP request method to be used when submitting the form to the server. Default is GET
 but in many cases, using a POST request makes for a better user experience because requests of this type can submit the
 form data in the body of the request, while GET requests add the form fields to the URL, cluttering the browser address
 bar -->

<!-- The novalidate attribute tells the web browser to not apply validation to the fields in this form, which effectively
 leaves this task to the Flask application running in the server. Using novalidate is entirely optional, but for this first form it is important that you set it because this will allow you to test server-side validation later in this chapter.-->
